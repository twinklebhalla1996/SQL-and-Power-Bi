Location - Delhi, India
I am a commerce student who upon exploring some of the programming languages (it all started with SQL) and data analytics field happened to find liking in it. I am now looking for opportunities to learn and develop my skills as much as I can and make a career in Data Analytics field.

A little fun fact about me -
I have never taken any tuitions in my entire life. I was a school rank holder in 12th boards. I believe in self study. 

Please find all my projects here in this repository.
