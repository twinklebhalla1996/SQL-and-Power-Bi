Name - Twinkle Bhalla<br /> 
DOB - 20/07/1996<br /> 
Location - Delhi, India<br /> 
I am a commerce student who upon exploring some of the programming languages (it all started with SQL) and data analytics field happened to find liking in it. I am now looking for opportunities to learn and develop my skills as much as I can and make a career in Data Analytics field.<br /> 

A little fun fact about me -<br /> 
I have never taken any tuitions in my entire life. I was a rank holder in 12th boards in my school and I achieved that through self-study and that's what I believe in, self-study. <br /> 

Please find all my projects here in this repository. <br />
